# React boiler plate for large scalable projects.

If you have more basic concepts which can help our fellow react developers or a great idea for this boiler plate please feel free to create a pull request. I am open for every contribution. I will learn from you and I hope this boiler plate will also help you in developing large scalable projects.

### What is included in this boiler plate?

✅ React basic and nested routing using `react-router-dom`

✅ `Authentication guard` and `User based guard` as router guards

✅ `Layout structure` for different users

✅ `Custom Hooks` for local storage

✅ `Lazy Loading` for dynamic importing of components to reduce our main bundle size.

✅ Live API call using `Axios`

✅ `useContext()` for data sharing throughout the application

✅ `Axios Interceptor` as `custom hook` for header and base URL **(Avoid using passing of headers in every service file)**

✅ `React-redux` & `React-tookit` for **state management**

✅ `Prime React` and `Bootstrap` as our UI library

✅ `Login page`, `Users list` and `Products list` with live API call.
